    "## Description\n",
    "Utilizing the GPUs for end-to-end data science projects (including ETL and data processing) can drastically decrease computation time.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Because resources are freed up much sooner, multiple iterations of a project (or different projects) can be completes in the same time it would have taken to run one single iteration of a project using the CPU.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video\n",
    "* A short (insert time here) video presentation can be found here(video to come).  \n",
    "    **Please start by watching this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slides\n",
    "* a **PDF** of the slides from the video can be found [here](docs/Why_use_GPU_over_CPU.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "* For **ETL**, we see more than **85% reduction in time**\n",
    "* For **Machine Learning**, we see a more than **98% reduction in time**\n",
    "* **End-to-end**, we see a more than **95% reduction in time**    \n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "* All datasets had 10 columns\n",
    "* We tested datasets with 500k rows, 1 million rows, 2 millions rows, 4 millions rows, and 20 million rows   \n",
    "    (8 million rows was not test, but the dataset is available).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### ETL functionality\n",
    "Each dataset tested went through the following ETL steps:\n",
    "1. csv file **read**\n",
    "2. csv file **write**\n",
    "3. **describe** dataframe\n",
    "4. **set index** of dataframe for each columns\n",
    "5. **concatenated** 3 dataframes, each 1/3 the size of the data\n",
    "6. performed a **groupby aggregation** on each categorical column to find mean.\n",
    "7. **fit label encoder** on each categorical column\n",
    "8. **encoded categorical columns**\n",
    "9. **scaled value columns**\n",
    "10. **split data** into train, val, and test partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning models\n",
    "For each dataset, the following models were fitted after ETL:  \n",
    "1. OLS Regression\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression\n",
    "3. K-Means\n",
    "4. Random Forest\n",
    "5. Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files\n",
    "The dataset used was a **fake dataset** generated by me.   \n",
    "It is a binary classification problem for detecting counterfeit drugs.  \n",
